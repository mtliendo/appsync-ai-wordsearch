## Overview

The AI Wordsearch Generator is a web application that allows users to create custom wordsearch puzzles. Users can enter their desired rows and columns, as well as a theme, and the application will generate a set of 10 words related to that theme. These words are then populated into a word bank, and users can click a "create grid" button to generate a wordsearch puzzle based on those words.

The application also includes a "print" button that allows users to print the wordsearch puzzle and word bank.

## Tech Stack

The AI Wordsearch Generator is built using the following technologies:

- **Hosting**: AWS Amplify
